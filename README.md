This project proposes an algorithm to detect disease-related spots on leaves with low computational cost using basic image processing techniques. By analyzing color channels and the standard deviation from grayscale images, spots of various colors, sizes, and types are identified through an elimination mechanism.
Firstly, the file named 'main_code.m' was used to develop our initial algorithm and was tested solely with the image 'leaf.jpg'. Later, the file named 'dataset_code.m' was created to open the sample images in the dataset folder one by one. By adjusting the file path sections in the code, you can modify it to work with your own samples.
